# RANDOM JOKE GENERATOR

## Description
Returns randomly selected hilarious jokes.http://127.0.0.1:5501/. Every time you click the button or hover the joke text, a new random dad joke should be fetched from the API and displayed and the button text will change occasionally.



## Setup
Navigate to your project directory and open up index.html
We have some basic HTML to start. We have a div  that contains a button for clicking to showcase the jokes and one in the <p> tags to showcase the joke.

Use api from https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api
Next create a function that will be responsible for fetching the joke.
